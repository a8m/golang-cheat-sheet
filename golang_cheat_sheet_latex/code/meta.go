// GO IN A NUTSHELL

// Imperative language
// Statically typed
// Syntax tokens similar to C (but less parentheses and no semicolons) and the structure to Oberon-2
// Compiles to native code (no JVM)
// No classes, but structs with methods
// Interfaces
// No implementation inheritance. There's type embedding, though.
// Functions are first class citizens
// Functions can return multiple values
// Has closures
// Pointers, but not pointer arithmetic
// Built-in concurrency primitives: Goroutines and Channels
